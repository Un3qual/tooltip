{"name":"Tooltip","tagline":"","body":"#**Tooltips**\r\nTooltips is a simple tooltip *tool* (hehe) that skips the bullshit. Crafted with love using `JQuery` and `CSS`. It was designed with ease of use in mind. \r\n\r\n## Just Get Started Already!\r\nIt's super simple to start using *Tooltips*. Just add `data-tooltip=\"tooltip content\"` to the element that you want to add the element to. \r\n\r\n###Examples\r\n```html\r\n<p>I gobble down a row of Double Stuf <span data-tooltip=\"YUCK!\">Golden</span> Oreos and a peanut butter sandwich, all sloshed down with a pint of chocolate milk. \r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon I stop at Five Guys to devour a <span data-tooltip=\"a fuck ton of bacon\">double bacon</span> cheeseburger and a monster order of sodium-loaded fries. \r\n\r\nFinally, before going to bed, I knock off a bag of <span data-tooltip=\"Okay, I want\">Philly Cheese Steak Rippled Potato Chips</span>--<span data-tooltip=\"I just had a thought-mouthgasm\">dripping with onion dip</span>.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nWant to make a theme?
